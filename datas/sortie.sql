1	\N	Apple and Pear Insect Control For Homeowners (Codling Moth)	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/pear-apple-codling-moth.jpg	There are few experiences that equal biting into a crisp, flavorful apple; few worse than finding half a worm in the remaining portion. Worms infesting apples and pears are immature larvae of codling moth.					\N
2	\N	Apple Aphids	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/apple-aphid.jpg	Aphids are common, secondary pests of apples, but infestations resulting in economic loss are uncommon, except for woolly apple aphid. Aphids overwinter as eggs on tree limbs, or as nymphs on roots and/or limbs.					\N
3	\N	Brown Marmorated Stink Bug - Samurai Wasp Parasitoid	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/samurai-wasp.jpg	Brown marmorated stink bug is an invasive insect that first invaded Utah in 2012.  It has since caused urban nuisance problems for northern Utah residents and poses a serious threat to various commerical fruit and vegetable crops. In June 2019, the samurai wasp was discovered in Salt Lake City. This exotic parasitoid wasp is the most promising agent for biological control of BMSB and is uniquely evolved to lay its eggs inside of BMSB eggs.					\N
4	\N	Bumble Flower Beetle	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/bumble-flower-beetle.jpg	Bumble flower beetles are common throughout the growing season on flowers, oozing sap, and other sweet, overripe, or fermenting matter. Bumble flower beetles seldom warrant the use of chemicals for control.					\N
5	\N	Cankerworms	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/cankerworms.jpg	Both spring and fall cankerworms occur sporadically in Utah, typically on a five to seven year cycle. Larvae feed for six weeks in the spring and cause heavy defoliation in outbreak years.					\N
6	\N	Peach Twig Borer	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/peach-twig-borer.jpg	Peach twig borer is a major pest of peach, nectarine and apricot in Utah. There are multiple generations each year. Spring and early summer generations of larvae bore into and kill new shoots while later summer larvae attack fruit, typically entering fruit near the stem end.					\N
7	\N	Peach Twig Borer Mating Disruption	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/peach-twig-borer-disruption.jpg	Peach twig borer is a key pest of peach, nectarine, and apricot. Mating disruption does not kill insects; it saturates the orchard with the female moth sex pheromone to delay or prevent mating.					\N
8	\N	Pear Fruit Sawfly	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/pear-fruit-saw-fly.jpg	Pear fruit sawfly (Hoplocampa brevis) was first identified in Utah in 2015. It is different from another pest of the same name that feeds on foliage--also known as pear slug (Caliroa cerasi)--and feeds exclusively within pear fruitlets in early spring.					\N
9	\N	Pear Psylla	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/pear-psylla.jpg	Pear psylla is an important pest of pear in Utah. Young and adult psylla feed in leaf phloem tissues, producing sticky honeydew. Psylla can cause fruit russetting and stunt trees; psylla shock and transmission of pear decline can kill trees.					\N
10	\N	Shothole Borer	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/shothole-borer.jpg	Shothole borers can cause damage to ornamental and fruit trees in Utah and adults are present from spring to early fall. Stressed or injured trees are more prone to attack.					\N
11	\N	Spongy Moth	/pests/caps/images/gm-4-5.jpg	Spongy moth is formerly known as European gypsy moth, whose name was changed in 2022 to remove a culturally insensitive term. Spongy moth is among the topmost devastating pests in North America. It has previously been detected and eradicated in Utah.					\N
12	\N	White Apple Leafhopper	/pests/images/factsheets/labels-archive/white-apple-leafhopper.jpg	White apple leafhopper is an indirect pest with two generations per year. Decision for control should be based on economic justifications as well as orchard and other pest considerations.					\N
13	\N	Homalodisca vitripennis	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/E003221.jpg	General color brown to black. Crown, pronotum, and scutellum brown or black with numerous ivory or yellowish spots, surface coarsely rugulose; elytra subhyaline.(Nielson, 1968)	Homalodisca	Very large, robust species. Length of male 11.50 - 12.50 mm., female 11.80 - 13.80 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is closely related to Lacerta in general habitus and genital characteristics and can be separated by the aedeagus with the curved lateral atrial processes, which are serrate distally. References to this species as triquetra by American authors are erroneous. Schroder in 1957 (669) first suppressed coagulata as a synonym of vitripennis (Germar), but in 1958 Young (881) resurrected coagulata and stated that triquetra was a valid South American species and did not occur in the United States. (Nielson 1968)	\N
14	\N	Orosius argentatus	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14310.jpg	<p>General color light brown to dark brown. Crown grey to light brown, disk with brown or black spots and reticulate markings; pronotum light brown with small dark-brown reticulations; elytra light grey with numerous brown or black markings bordering cells and numerous reticulations among cells.(Nielson, 1968)</p>	Orosius	Small, linear species. Length of male 2.90—3.00 mm., female 3.00mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is one of two in the genus Orosius that is a vector of a plant virus, and it can be separated from albicinctus by the aedeagus with shafts nearly parallel in ventral aspect. No résumés or illustrations of albicinctus are presented here owing to lack of authentically determined material.<br>In 1960, Linnavouri (462) transferred Orosius argentatus to the genus Nesophrosyne on the basis that the former genus was congeneric ith the latter. Later in 1960, he (463) suppressed argentatus as a synonym of N. lotophagorum (Kirkaldy) without access to type material. According to Ghauri (personal communication), who had finished a revision of Orosius at the time of this writing, argentatus is distinct from lotophagorum and belongs in the genus Orosius.<br><br>(Nielson 1968)<br>	\N
15	\N	Scaphytopius acutus	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14246.jpg	General colour brown. Crown with brown longitudinal striate markings; pronotum with brown reticulated markings; elytra with brown reticulations and occasional ivory spots.</br>(Nielson, 1968)	Scaphytopius	male 4.20—4.70 mm., female 4.80—5.30 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is similar to delongi in genital characteristics and can be separated by the aedeagal paraphyses, which are crossed over once. There is considerable variation among the forms assigned to this species. Typical acutus occurs in the Eastern United States and Canada and has once-crossed aedeagal paraphyses whereas western forms from Washington, Oregon, and Utah usually have once-crossed but sometimes twice-crossed aedeagal paraphyses. The western forms are also darker and the crown is much more produced and pointed than in the eastern forms.</br> Other closely related species in the Western United States, particularly delongi Young, graneticus (Ball), utahensis Hepner, canus Hepner, dubius (Van Duzee), and oregonensis (Baker), </br></br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N

16	\N	Agallia albidula	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14067.jpg	General color light tan to brown. Vertex with two distinct round black spots; pronotum light brown; elytra with light-brown markings along middle of commissure giving body banded appearance in darker specimens.(Nielson, 1968)	Agallia	male 3.40—3.50 mm., female 3.55-3.75 mm, (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species, allied to constricta and quadripunctata, can easily be separated from both species by the pygofer with a narrow fingerlike lobe arising from the caudoventral margin and the short, recurved aedeagus.</br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N
17	\N	Unkanodes albifascia	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14732.jpg		Unkanodes	Brachypterous male 1.7-1.9 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Delphacidae	The male genitalia are diagnostic (Figs 3.117-3.124).</br>(Wilson & Claridge 1991)	\N
18	\N	Anoscopus albifrons	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14844.jpg	General color light brown to dark brown. Crown and pronotum uniformly dark brown; elytra with brown transverse bands in male, unicolorous in female.(Nielson, 1968)	Anoscopus	Small, robust species. Length of male 3.35 mm., female 4.45 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	From bicincta, to which it is similar, albifrons can be separated by the aedeagus with paired processes near the apex of the shaft and the smaller gonopore situated near midlength of the shaft.</br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N
19	\N	Terthron albovittatum	http://insectvectors.science/files/specimens/i14810.jpg		Terthron	Macropterous male 2.6-3.0 mm, female 3.2-3.4 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Delphacidae	General colour dark brown with pale yellow dorsal median stripe extending from vertex to apex of mesonotum (Fig. 3.126). Face black with white carinae (Fig. 3.127). Male genitalia as Figs 3.128-3.132.</br>(Wilson & Claridge 1991)</br>	\N
20	\N	Psammotettix alienus		General color tannish brown. Crown tan with bight-brown patches on disk; pronotum tannish brown; ebytra tan, cells bordered with brown, Veins ivory or tan.(Nielson, 1968)	Psammotettix	Small, linear species. Length of male 3.80—4.10 mm., female 4. 10—4.30 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is closely related to striatus and difficult to separate on the basis of general habitus and male genital characteristics. I have followed Ribaut (643) in his 1952 interpretation of the species, which distinguished alienus from striatus by the aedeagus, which is truncate apically in lateral aspect and emarginate apicaily in ventral aspect.</br></br></br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N

Crown tan; pronotum tan, unicolorous; elytra brown, apex dark brown.(Nielson, 1968)	Acinopterus	Medium size, robust species. male 5.10—5.90 mm., female 5.80—6.20 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This is the only species in the genus Acinopterus that is a reported vector of plant viruses. </br></br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N
24	\N	Paraphlepsius apertinus		General colour light brown to dark brown with numerous, dark, fine reticulations on body. Crown tan with reticulations; pronoturn light brown, reticulated; elytra ivory with numerous fine dark-brown or black reticulations.</br>(Nielson, 1968)	Paraphlepsius	Medium size, robust species. male 5.50—6.60 mm., female 5.50—6.80 mm.</br> (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This is the only species in the genus Paraphlepsius that is a known vector of a plant virus. It can be distinguished from other vector species by the characters in the key to the genera. The male genitalia were illustrated by DeLong and Severin in 1945, Crowder in 1952 (149), and Beirne in 1956.

(Nielson, 1968)	Delphacidae	<p>Male pygofer with spined process (Figs 3.13, 3.20) arising medially from ventral margin. Parameres bifurcate apically as in Fig. 3.15. Aedeagus as in Fig. 3.19. In the female valvifer VIII (lateral lobes in Mochida and Okada, 1979) is diagnostic in <em>N. bakeri,</em> being distinctly hook-like at the basal portion (Fig. 3.21). Some authors (e.g. Mochida and Okada, 1979) have used the character of an excavation of the median carina of the frons as being diagnostic. However, we consider this character to be rather variable and the genitalia of both male and female to be much more reliable.</p><p>(Wilson &amp; Claridge 1991)</p>	\N

Crown light green with distinct black transverse line near anterior margin; pronotum with anterior half green, posterior half brown; scutellum green; elytra light green, broad brown or black band on apex in males; markings absent in females; green turns gray in old specimen.Males — head with black submarginal band between eyes, apical third of forewing black. Females — similar in coloration to many nigropictus females; submarginal band of vertex often not touching inner margins of eyes, forewings without dark markings.(Nielson, 1968)	Nephotettix	Length of male 4.30—4.50 mm., female 5.00—5.60 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	The rounded head and markings in the males resemble those in nigropictus but may be easily separated from this species by the male genitalia, particularly the spine number (5 pairs) and the shape of the parameres. In coloration females may be confused with some N. nigropictus but the submarginal band is not fully extended between eyes and the inner margin of the clavus is never black. Males may sometimes resemble N. nigropictus but never have the inner margin of the clavus black.</br></br>The black markings of N. cincticeps are similar to those of N. parvus, a tropical Asian species, but the head is broadly rounded instead of pointed as in N. parvus. In cases where male N. cincticeps cannot be distinguished from other Nephotettix species by external morphological characteristics, they can be separated by examination of the genitalia. The aedeagus in males of N. cincticeps has five pairs of spines located in the middle of the aedeagal shaft, as opposed to eight in N. nigripictus and one in N. parvus. The shape of the paramere is also diagnostic, with the internal process curved.</br></br>(Wilson & Claridge 1991)	\N

(Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	Since this is the only species in the genus Helochara that is a vector of a plant virus, it can be separated from other species by characters in the key to the genera. The male genitalia were illustrated by DeLong and Severin in 1949 (197). In comparing the genitalia with authentically determined specimens of communis Fitch, I find no basis for retaining delta as a distinct species and therefore have suppressed it under communis.

Color variations were evident but not recommended for separating the species. I have followed Wagner (843, 844) after he carefully studied several species in which he concluded that nassatus, nitidula, and rubi were conspecific with fuscula in 1950 and 1964.

It is essential that this problem be restudied thoroughly in view of the economic importance of the species. It is beyond the scope of this bulletin to present an elucidation of the various forms assigned to the species.

Length of male 11.50 - 12.50 mm., female 11.80 - 13.80 mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is closely related to Lacerta in general habitus and genital characteristics and can be separated by the aedeagus with the curved lateral atrial processes, which are serrate distally. References to this species as triquetra by American authors are erroneous. Schroder in 1957 (669) first suppressed coagulata as a synonym of vitripennis (Germar), but in 1958 Young (881) resurrected coagulata and stated that triquetra was a valid South American species and did not occur in the United States.

Length of male 2.90—3.00 mm., female 3.00mm. (Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is one of two in the genus Orosius that is a vector of a plant virus, and it can be separated from albicinctus by the aedeagus with shafts nearly parallel in ventral aspect. No résumés or illustrations of albicinctus are presented here owing to lack of authentically determined material.<br>In 1960, Linnavouri (462) transferred Orosius argentatus to the genus Nesophrosyne on the basis that the former genus was congeneric ith the latter. Later in 1960, he (463) suppressed argentatus as a synonym of N. lotophagorum (Kirkaldy) without access to type material. According to Ghauri (personal communication), who had finished a revision of Orosius at the time of this writing, argentatus is distinct from lotophagorum and belongs in the genus Orosius.<br><br>(Nielson 1968)<br>	\N

(Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This species is similar to delongi in genital characteristics and can be separated by the aedeagal paraphyses, which are crossed over once. There is considerable variation among the forms assigned to this species. Typical acutus occurs in the Eastern United States and Canada and has once-crossed aedeagal paraphyses whereas western forms from Washington, Oregon, and Utah usually have once-crossed but sometimes twice-crossed aedeagal paraphyses. The western forms are also darker and the crown is much more produced and pointed than in the eastern forms.</br> Other closely related species in the Western United States, particularly delongi Young, graneticus (Ball), utahensis Hepner, canus Hepner, dubius (Van Duzee), and oregonensis (Baker), </br></br>(Nielson 1968)</br>	\N

(Nielson, 1968)	Cicadellidae	This is the only species in the genus Agalliopsis that is a known vector.</br>This species may undergo restriction owing to structural variation of the pygofer spine. Oman (1933) found differences in the shape of the pygofer spine among populations collected from numerous localities in North America, but he was unable to determine the significance of this character owing to paucity of specimens. It is essential that this problem be restudied thoroughly in view of the economic importance of the species. It is beyond the scope of this bulletin to present an elucidation of the various forms assigned to the species.
