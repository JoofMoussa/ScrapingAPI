The first symptom, a whitish dot within a rapidly expanding brown area, appears 10 to 14 days after infection. Within a few days, the berry starts to shrivel and becomes a hard, blue-black mummy. If berries are infected close to the onset of natural resistance, lesions remain localized. The fungus over-winters in mummies within the vine or on the ground. Ascospores are released shortly after bud break until about 2 weeks after bloom and are dispersed by wind and rain.

In spring, buds and young shoots may be infected and turn brown. In late spring, V-shaped or irregular brown patches may appear on leaves. Inflorescences may become blighted and wither away. Some flower infections remain latent until veraison. Once infections become activated, they spread rapidly from berry to berry. Compact clusters, powdery mildew infection, hail and insect damage, high nitrogen content and rain cracking can predispose grapes to infection. The disease is favored by temperatures of 59 to 68ºF (15 to 20ºC) and spreads rapidly during rainy periods, especially close to harvest. In certain cultivars, slow developing late-season infections are termed “noble rot” because they contribute to the production of exceptionally sweet wines.

Initial leaf symptoms are light green to yellow spots, called “oil spots” because they appear greasy. Under humid conditions, white, downy spore masses can be seen on the lower leaf surface. These spores are wind dispersed. The lesions eventually turn brown as the infected tissue dies. Severely infected leaves drop prematurely, which can reduce winter hardiness of the vine. Infected flower clusters dry up or become covered with white spores under humid conditions. Infected berries turn a mottled dull green or reddish purple and readily fall from the cluster. Although berries become resistant to infection within 3 weeks after bloom, the rachis remains susceptible for several weeks longer. The pathogen overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. In spring, spores are carried by rain splash to new leaves, where they require a film of water for infection. Lesions appear 5 to 17 days after infection. The disease can spread rapidly under warm conditions with frequent rain or dew. Use the 10-10-10 rule to decide when to start scouting for downy mildew: at least 10 cm (4 in.) of shoot growth, 10 mm (0.4 in.) rainfall and temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) during a 24-hour period.','','','','');insert into insecte(nom,image_url,description_insecte,partie1,partie2,famille,diagnostic) values ('DRY EYE ROT (BLOSSOM END ROT)','https://www.canr.msu.edu/contentAsset/image/e03a9ced-2a9f-41e8-bfe2-9f04cda59d5a/fileAsset/filter/Resize,Crop/resize_w/300/crop_w/300/crop_h/200/crop_x/0/crop_y/0?language_id=','Symptoms begin at the calyx end of the fruit, causing a reddish discoloration at the site of infection.
